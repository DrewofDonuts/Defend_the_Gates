 * Product Overview

 This pack is divided into two categories since it contains two types of foliage shader that are different from each other; "The Toby Foliage Engine" and "Custom Tree Importer".


 ** (CTI - Custom Tree Importer shader) The vegetation contains and works with the third-party tool Custom Tree Importer (CTI) which is compatible with Advanced Foliage Shader. The custom tree importer shaders provide realistic-looking wind and foliage with a minimum performance impact.

 ** (TTFE - The Toby Foliage Engine) is a new lightweight, fast, and innovative single-pivot vegetation system made with "Amplify Shader Editor" that attempts to simulate multiple pivots per mesh, similar to "Pivot Painter". These shaders provide a comprehensive solution for achieving realistic wind and plant shading. Its seamless integration and user-friendly interface make applying it to any mesh easy. There is no need to worry about conversion or any cumbersome steps as the shaders streamline this process. You also have the ability to adjust settings such as wind and seasons using the global controller gizmo.

 This pack only includes the free version which has limitations! Unleash the potential of the fully featured version here: The Toby Foliage Engine --->
