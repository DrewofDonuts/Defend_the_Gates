How to manager data persistence when moving between scenes

Two options
1) Just save anyway - persist and autosave, then just reload the data when you load the scene

2) Done in the coursework - have a datastructure that holds onto the information and then when you load the scene, 
you can just pass the datastructure to the new scene

Also have to save off the state of all the specific scenes (things killed, doors opened, etc.) and then load that
when you load the scene
* if a couple hundred items, can just hold in memory on some object. 
* otherwise, just hold some level data structure and autosave 



use additive always - bootstrapper class to load
