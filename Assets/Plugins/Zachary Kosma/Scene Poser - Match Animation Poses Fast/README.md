# Match Animator Pose Editor

## Overview
The **Match Animator Pose Editor** is a custom Unity Editor tool that allows animators and developers to quickly apply a pose from an animation clip to an **Animator GameObject** in the Unity Editor. This can be useful for setting up character poses, previewing animations at specific frames, or manually tweaking animation poses before keyframing.

## Features
- Select an **Animation Clip** from an Animator Controller.
- Apply the **first frame pose** of the selected clip to the GameObject.
- Works non-destructively—animation clips remain unchanged.
- Supports **Undo functionality**, allowing users to revert changes.

## Installation
1. Create a new **Editor** folder inside your Unity project (if not already present).
2. Save the following script inside the **Editor** folder:
    - `MatchAnimatorPoseEditor.cs`
3. Attach an `Animator` component to a GameObject and assign an **Animator Controller** with Animation Clips.

## Usage
1. Select a GameObject with an `Animator` component in the Unity Editor.
2. Open the **Inspector** window.
3. Use the custom editor UI to choose an **Animation Clip** from the attached Animator Controller.
4. Click the **"Match Selected Animation Pose"** button.
5. The GameObject will adopt the first frame pose of the selected animation.
6. Use **Undo (Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z)** if you want to revert the changes.

## How It Works
- The script retrieves animation clips from the assigned **Animator Controller**.
- It applies the first frame of the selected **Animation Clip** to the GameObject using:
  ```csharp
  clip.SampleAnimation(animator.gameObject, 0f);
  ```
- The object’s state is marked as changed using:
  ```csharp
  EditorUtility.SetDirty(animator.gameObject);
  ```
- Full object hierarchy is saved for Undo support:
  ```csharp
  Undo.RegisterFullObjectHierarchyUndo(animator.gameObject, "Match Animator Pose");
  ```

## Limitations
- **Does not modify animation clips permanently**—it only applies the pose to the GameObject.
- Currently **only samples the first frame** of an animation clip.
- Works **only in the Unity Editor** (not at runtime).

## Future Enhancements
- Support for applying a pose from **any frame** of an animation clip.
- Adding a timeline scrubber for finer control over pose selection.
- Option to bake sampled poses into an **AnimationClip**.
